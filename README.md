CodeSphere

CodeSphere is a real-time collaborative coding platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. It brings together features of an online IDE, Git version control, and AI-powered coding assistance — all in the browser.

Think of it as a VS Code in your browser, with real-time collaboration, presence indicators, AI coding assistant, and even voice chat.
